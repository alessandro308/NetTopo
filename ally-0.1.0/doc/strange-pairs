Ramesh,

Here's a small sample of apparent alias pairs from verio:

129.250.16.46 129.250.50.33
129.250.116.121 129.250.29.20
131.103.128.225 129.250.50.62
129.250.27.162 129.250.27.194
129.250.46.52 129.250.46.36
199.238.112.34 204.203.0.150
129.250.27.10 129.250.215.57
129.250.122.154 129.250.122.93
61.120.144.61 61.120.144.93
129.250.3.237 129.250.2.98
209.245.240.154 216.32.173.142
199.217.254.70 199.217.254.74
161.58.130.25 161.58.130.29
130.94.197.1 129.250.16.234
204.42.201.177 204.42.202.89
157.238.230.117 129.250.31.57
165.254.191.1 165.254.191.5
204.247.122.142 206.86.241.61
64.86.173.130 209.1.169.250

There are 948 ip address pairs in our database that matched
ipid and return ttl, but not any of the ip-address based
heursitics.  Some of these pairs, but very few based on
ad-hoc sampling, either do return the same ip address,
or were "unlucky" collisions in the ipid space and not
actually aliases.  We haven't yet run a second-pass
confirmation analysis over the database.  We can get you
the complete list after the second pass, if that's helpful.

enjoy,

Neil,

For each of the pairs you gave me:
 - ran my version of the IP ID test
 - ran my version of the alias resolution test
 - ran traceroutes

Here are the results, best viewed in emacs outline-mode with
font-locking turned on :-)

Login: xxxxx Password: xxxxx

There are some oddities (see my comments at the beginning of each
pair), but the conclusion does seem to be that the IP ID test is more
robust than the alias resolution test.

I'm guessing Juniper implements responses to traceroutes differently
(Verio, I'm told, uses Junipers). My previous tests had been
on Ciscos and Bays.

Thanks,
Ramesh

Well, as long as you're characterizing wacky router
behavior, take a look at these (my personal favorites):

 61.120.146.46 61.213.160.78
 209.227.0.150 209.227.0.114
 157.238.28.214 157.238.28.210
 130.94.42.118 130.94.42.6

Traceroutes are returned from the other IP address in
the pair.  I've only found 10 such IP address pairs with 
this behavior.  They match the ipid test.  I don't know  
what the explanation is.

Speaking of wacky behavior, here are some pairs
which fail (at least my implementation of) the IP ID test,
but whose traceroutes terminate at the same node:

198.32.136.91 193.38.108.76
167.152.2.49 167.152.2.14
203.134.44.1 203.134.12.1

Per-interface identifiers?

Regards,
Ramesh
