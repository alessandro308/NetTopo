(an early email while developing that describes the
matrix)


Ok.  The current scheme is the following.  The minimum
number of tests that must be made to resolve all ips to
their aliased routers is N_routers^2 + N_interfaces...
I think.  This should be closer to 10K than 160K.

The bullshit theory framework is a graph coloring problem.
Each address is a node.  The graph is fully connected,
and starts out colored black (don't know).  A discovered
alias colors the edge between nodes red.  Since "alias"
is an equivalence relation, additional red edges can be
drawn to complete the transitive closure.  When an alias
is disproven, green edges can be drawn between all nodes
that represent both routers.  There's a little more to it
than this, and I'm pretty sure there's a more convenient
way to express the problem in theory land, but I can at
least reason about how to implement this.

So, the simple scheme is to pick a black edge, color it
red or green by using ally, then color related edges green
or red using the fact that red is transitive (a aliases b
and b aliases c, so a aliases c.  if a does not alias d,
neither do b or c.  if a also does not alias e, that means
nothing for d-e.)

The improvement is to try edges that look like they should
be red first.  So, the first step is to sort all ip/name
pairs by reversed hostname to group aliases close.  I know
it doesn't handle verio's scheme specifically, but it's
nice and general.  The second step is to iterate through
this list, checking adjacent nodes.  Then, iterate though
nearby clusters that haven't been colored.

This doesn't automatically de-alias based on return-ttl,
so it will do stupid things like try all routers in japan
against all routers, well, not in japan.

I want to cache ally's results in the database in the
process so that additional routers can be managed easily.
