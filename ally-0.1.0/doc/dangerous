while debugging, we found aliases that return the same ip
identifier (this has been fixed):

trying: 160.209.11.1 160.209.11.1/87
      : 149.117.11.1 149.117.11.1/86
1: from 149.117.11.1: id 1, ttl 52/246
0: from 160.209.11.1: id 1, ttl 50/244
3: from 149.117.11.1: id 1, ttl 52/246
1: from 149.117.11.1: id 1, ttl 52/246
0: from 160.209.11.1: id 1, ttl 50/244
3: from 149.117.11.1: id 1, ttl 52/246
insert into ally1239 (ip1, ip2, ipid, return_ttl, out_ttl, same_ip, b_returns_a, a_returns_b, cisco) values
+('160.209.11.1', '149.117.11.1', 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1)


should probably make sure the ipid's are distinct too.
these were considered aliases. yes, packets seem to have
been duplicated, it's not clear how or where.
