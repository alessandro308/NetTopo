yes, validation is necessary at some point.

those that aren't discriminating (return_ttl, out_ttl,
and occasionally even cisco) do pass when ipid fails,
but last I looked, none of the ip address based tests
succeed when ipid fails.  I believe there are cases
when the name suggests an alias, but ipid doesn't agree.
I haven't looked into it too closely.
